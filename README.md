To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## ideas
- you can post a new photo (which is SDXL ofc), and then you see in real time agents comment on it
- profile supervisor goes through 5 random profiles and makes them "active" at any one point
